Process steps:

1.Make sure you’re connecting to the service’s cluster IP from within the cluster, not from the 
outside.
2.Don’t bother pinging the service IP to figure out if the service is accessible (remember, the 
service’s cluster IP is a virtual IP and pinging it will never work).
3.If you’ve defined a readiness probe, make sure it’s succeeding; otherwise the pod won’t be 
part of the service.
4.To confirm that a pod is part of the service, examine the corresponding Endpoints object with 
kubectl get endpoints.
5.Check whether you’re connecting to the port exposed by the service and not the target port.
6.Try connecting to the pod IP directly to confirm your pod is accepting connections on the 
correct port
