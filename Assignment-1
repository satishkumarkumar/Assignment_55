Write a common use-case, where you will use a daemon set instead of replica set.
In daemon set will create a pod in every node running in our cluster using nodeselector 
if we particular create pod in that node labelled with test we want to check application as testing purpose so label node with test
eg 
kubectl label node "workernode name" type=tester
now 
edit daemonset file
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: tester
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: tester
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: tester
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        type: tester
      containers:
      - name: main
        image: luksa/tester
Pods created in worker node where labelled with tester

In other hand

Replicaset uses where larges number of pods are required for running.eg deployment configuration
